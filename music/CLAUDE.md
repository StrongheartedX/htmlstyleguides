## Hub Page (index.html)

- Loads song data dynamically from `audio-tracker/songs/index.json` via fetch()
- Song browser with search, category filter, and sortable columns (title/BPM/category)
- Action buttons per song: Tracker, Visualizer, Video (if available)
- Video availability determined by a JS lookup set (not all songs have videos)

## Cross-References

Games that use music resources (e.g., Survivors arena themes) reference files via `../../music/audio-tracker/` relative paths.

## Adding a New Song

1. Create the song JSON in `audio-tracker/songs/`
2. Add an entry to `audio-tracker/songs/index.json`
3. The hub page picks it up automatically (no hub page edits needed)
4. Optionally create a video in `visualizer/` and add its slug to the VIDEO_SLUGS set in `index.html`
