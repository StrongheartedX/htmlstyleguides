{"id":"htmlstyleguides-229","title":"Keyboard Guitar Hero — rhythm game using the sheet music renderer","description":"Build a Guitar Hero-style rhythm game where notes scroll toward a fixed playhead and the player hits keyboard keys to score points. The sheet music visualizer renderer already implements 90% of the visual mechanic.\n\n## Concept\n\nNotes scroll right-to-left on a grand staff, approaching a glowing cursor line. The player presses keys when notes cross the cursor to score hits. Accuracy windows (perfect/great/good/miss) determine points and combo multipliers. Could live in `games/` or as a mode within the visualizer.\n\n## Existing Infrastructure\n\n### Sheet Music Renderer (`music/visualizer/renderers/sheet-music.js`)\n- Scrolling grand staff with treble + bass clefs\n- Notes color-coded by channel (gold/rose/purple/silver → 4 lanes)\n- Duration beams showing note length\n- Glowing playhead at 15% from left edge\n- Binary-search indexed timeline for efficient visible-note lookup\n- `findFirst(rowThreshold)` already finds notes near the cursor\n- Notes have `atCursor` detection (row \u003c= currentRowFrac \u0026\u0026 noteEnd \u003e currentRowFrac)\n\n### Visualizer Engine (`music/visualizer/engine.js`)\n- `frameData.cursor.totalFracRow` — precise fractional scroll position\n- `frameData.analysis.timeline[row][ch]` — all note data pre-analyzed\n- `frameData.analysis.channelRoles` — lead/harmony/bass/percussion per channel\n- `frameData.currentNotes[ch]` — what's playing right now\n- `frameData.analysis.rpb` — rows per beat for timing windows\n- Song library of 57 songs at various difficulties\n\n### Music Video Integration\nThe visualizer's music videos (`music/visualizer/music-videos/`) are self-contained HTML pages that load engine.js + playback-engine.js. A Guitar Hero mode could overlay on any video as a secondary canvas/UI, or be a standalone renderer. Frame callbacks (`Visualizer.addFrameCallback`) let secondary renderers subscribe to the same timing data.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n- **Input mapping**: 4 channels → 4 keys (e.g., D/F/J/K or similar). Each channel is already color-coded.\n- **Hit detection**: Compare key press time against note arrival at cursor. Use `analysis.secondsPerRow` to convert row distance to timing windows.\n- **Scoring**: Perfect/Great/Good/Miss windows, combo multiplier, streak counter.\n- **Visual feedback**: Note glow/flash on hit, miss animation, combo counter display, score overlay.\n- **Difficulty**: Song BPM + note density naturally creates difficulty tiers. The song manifest has BPM data. Could auto-rate songs.\n- **\"Through the Fire and Flames\" is the boss level**: High BPM + dense 4-channel patterns = maximum difficulty.\n- **Could work as**: (a) a new visualizer renderer with input handling, (b) a standalone game page in `games/`, or (c) an overlay mode on music videos.\n\n## Tech Notes\n\n- Vanilla JS only, no frameworks (project rule)\n- The sheet music renderer is an IIFE on `window.Renderers` — could fork it or extend it with a game layer\n- `KeyboardEvent` listeners for input, `performance.now()` or `AudioContext.currentTime` for precise timing\n- Consider mobile tap zones for touchscreen play (the project runs on GitHub Pages, mobile-friendly is a plus)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-02-20T07:25:52Z","created_by":"GGPrompts","updated_at":"2026-02-20T07:50:49Z","closed_at":"2026-02-20T07:50:49Z","close_reason":"Built full Rhythm Hero game at games/rhythm-hero/index.html with sheet-music note highway, 4-key input (D/F/J/K), timing-based scoring, combo system, particle effects, and animated results screen"}
