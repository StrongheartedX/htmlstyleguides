If song.seq exists use as-is (compact). If song.sequence exists normalize on the fly: sequence to seq, expand sparse channels into dense ch arrays, map instrument fields if needed.\n\nThis is preferred over re-exporting songs because new songs will keep getting saved in tracker-native format.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- games/audio-tracker/playback-engine.js - add format detection and normalization in load()\n\n## Verification\n1. Load any survivors arena (arena.html?world=cyberpunk) - music should play after game starts\n2. Verify volume is reasonable (musicGain is 0.12 vs SFX master 0.4)\n3.
