# Interactive Story Creation Guide

Instructions for creating interactive stories from HTML style guides. Each story is a self-contained HTML file that reuses a style guide's CSS/components as the visual layer for an educational, branching narrative.

## Architecture

Every story follows the same pattern:

```
single-file.html
├── <style>        CSS from the style guide (adapted for story use)
├── <body>         Title screen + scene wrapper + overlays
└── <script>
    ├── STORY = {} Story data (scenes, text, choices, facts)
    └── engine     Lightweight JS engine (~80 lines)
```

No frameworks. No build step. No external dependencies beyond Google Fonts.

## The Engine

The engine is ~80 lines of JS that handles:
- Scene rendering (picks template based on scene type)
- State management (current scene, collected facts/knowledge)
- Transitions between scenes (style-appropriate animation)
- Keyboard support (1/2/3 keys for choices)
- Knowledge/fact tracker sidebar
- Restart functionality

Copy the engine pattern from any existing story and adapt the `render()` method for the new style guide's components.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Research Phase (Haiku)

For each style guide, research:

- **What cultural period/place does it represent?** (e.g., Bauhaus = Weimar Germany 1919-1933)
- **What real historical events happened in that period?** Find 8-12 key moments with real names, dates, numbers
- **What are the design principles of the style?** These become "lessons" woven into the story
- **What dramatic tension exists?** Every good story needs conflict (the crash, the Nazis, a mystery)
- **What component types exist in the style guide?** Map them to narrative functions

Output a research brief with:
```
Style: [name]
Period: [era and location]
Story concept: [1-2 sentence pitch]
Key historical facts: [8-12 bullet points with dates and numbers]
Dramatic arc: [setup → tension → climax → resolution]
Component mapping: [which CSS components map to which story elements]
Scene outline: [10-12 scenes with branching points]
```

### 2. Component Mapping

This is the key creative step. Map the style guide's CSS components to narrative functions:

| Narrative Need | How To Map It |
|---|---|
| Narration / voiceover | The style's "body text" component, or a distinctive element (typewriter paper for noir, message box for pixel art, narration block for bauhaus) |
| Exposition / world-building | Info cards, newspaper clippings, fact boxes — whatever the style uses to present secondary information |
| Dialogue / confrontation | Centered, dramatic presentation — interrogation light, game dialog box, quote blocks |
| Key reveals / plot points | The style's most visually striking component — game over screen, dark mode switch, composition grids |
| Choices | Buttons from the style guide, adapted to be full-width with numbering |
| Facts / knowledge collected | Badges, evidence tags, item cards — the style's "tag" or "label" component |
| Scene transitions | Animate a signature visual element — venetian blinds for noir, RGB color wipes for bauhaus, black flash for pixel art |
| Atmospheric background | Film grain, scanlines, fog, vignette — the style's overlay effects |

### 3. Story Structure

Aim for:
- **10-15 scenes** (enough for depth, short enough to finish in one sitting)
- **3-5 branching points** (real choices, not just "continue")
- **2-3 endings** (different perspectives on the same history)
- **1 convergence point** (branches rejoin before the climax so you don't need exponential scenes)

Standard arc:
```
Title Screen
  → Introduction (set the scene, establish the era)
  → Choice 1 (perspective/role selection — affects flavor, not plot)
  → Rising action (2-3 scenes of historical events)
  → Choice 2 (investigation/exploration branch)
  → Climax (the dramatic turning point)
  → Choice 3 (the big decision — affects ending)
  → Ending A / B / C
```

### 4. Scene Data Format

Each scene in the STORY object:

```javascript
scene_id: {
    // Metadata
    year: '1925',           // For HUD display (optional)
    era: 'DESSAU ERA',      // For header display (optional)
    health: 70,             // For health bar if applicable (optional)
    dark: false,            // Toggle dark mode for dramatic scenes (optional)

    // Content — raw HTML using the style guide's CSS classes
    content: `
        <div class="era-header">...</div>
        <div class="msg-box">
            <div class="msg-text">
                <p>Narrative text here...</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="fact-box">
            <div class="fact-label">// REAL HISTORY</div>
            <p>Educational content here...</p>
        </div>
    `,

    // Knowledge tracking
    fact: 'One-sentence fact that gets saved to the knowledge tracker',

    // Branching
    choices: [
        { text: 'Choice label', next: 'next_scene_id' },
        { text: 'Choice label', next: 'other_scene_id' }
    ]
}
```

### 5. Educational Content Guidelines

- **Real names, real dates, real numbers.** "Space Invaders earned $3.8 billion in quarters" is memorable. "The game was very popular" is not.
- **Teach through the experience, not lectures.** The CSS is doing half the teaching. The Bauhaus story uses Bauhaus geometry. The pixel art story uses health bars and game over screens.
- **Include surprising facts.** "Japan had a coin shortage" sticks. "The game sold well" doesn't.
- **Weave facts into narrative.** Don't separate "story" and "lesson" — the lesson IS the story. Use dedicated fact/lesson cards for deeper context.
- **Every scene should teach at least one thing** that gets added to the knowledge tracker.
- **The ending should connect past to present.** "Your phone descends from the Bauhaus" makes history feel alive.

### 6. Style Guide Component Reference

Read the target style guide HTML file and identify:

1. **Section/container components** — how content is grouped
2. **Card variants** — these become your scene "types"
3. **Typography classes** — headlines, body, captions
4. **Color palette** — especially accent colors for emphasis
5. **Special elements** — the unique, atmospheric stuff (film grain, scanlines, geometric shapes)
6. **Button styles** — these become your choice buttons
7. **Badge/tag components** — these become era markers and knowledge items
8. **Overlay effects** — these become transitions and atmosphere

## Audio Narration (Voice Cloning with Qwen3-TTS)

Stories can have read-aloud narration using AI voice cloning. The TTS setup is at `~/projects/qwen-tts-test/` and uses the Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base model on GPU.

### How It Works

1. **Reference clip** — A 5-10 second WAV of the target voice (clean speech, minimal background noise, mono 24kHz preferred)
2. **Reference transcript** — Exact text of what's spoken in the clip
3. **Voice cloning** — The model generates new speech in that voice from any input text
4. **Integration** — Audio files are loaded per-scene with a play/pause control in the story HTML

### Available Voice References

| Voice | Reference File | Transcript | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| James Earl Jones | `references/jej_disgraced.wav` | "You have disgraced yourself and you must be punished" | Dark/dramatic narration |
| JFK | `references/jfk_clean.wav` | "the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity" | Formal/patriotic topics |
| MLK Jr | `references/mlk_injustice.wav` | "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere" | Passionate/principled topics |
| Carl Sagan | `references/sagan_clean.wav` | "we humans have had civilization only for about ten thousand years our species is a few hundred thousand years old" | Science/space/wonder |

### Getting New Voice Clips

Use `yt-dlp` to extract audio clips from YouTube:

```bash
# Download a specific time range as WAV
yt-dlp -x --audio-format wav --download-sections "*7:43-7:57" \
  --force-keyframes-at-cuts -o "clip_name.%(ext)s" "YOUTUBE_URL"

# Get auto-generated transcript with timestamps to find good clips
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --sub-lang en --sub-format json3 \
  --skip-download -o "/tmp/transcript" "YOUTUBE_URL"

# Parse the transcript timestamps
python3 -c "
import json
with open('/tmp/transcript.en.json3') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
for e in data.get('events', []):
    if 'segs' in e:
        start_s = e.get('tStartMs', 0) / 1000
        text = ''.join(s.get('utf8', '') for s in e['segs']).strip()
        if text:
            print(f'{int(start_s//60)}:{start_s%60:05.2f}  {text}')
"
```

Convert downloaded clips to the preferred format (mono, 24kHz):
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.wav -ac 1 -ar 24000 -y output_clean.wav
```

### Batch Generation Script

The reusable generation script is at `~/projects/qwen-tts-test/generate_dark_academia.py`. To adapt it for a new story:

1. Update `REF_AUDIO` and `REF_TEXT` for the chosen voice
2. Update `OUTPUT_DIR` for the new story
3. Update `STORY_FILE` to point to the story HTML
4. Run: `source venv/bin/activate && echo "y" | python generate_script.py`

The script automatically:
- Extracts scene text from the STORY object in the HTML
- Strips HTML tags, images, and captions to get clean narration text
- Generates one WAV per scene, skipping already-generated files (resumable)
- Prints progress and timing for each scene

### Critical Generation Settings

These prevent stuck/runaway generation:

```python
# ALWAYS set max_new_tokens — without this, generation can run forever
wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_clone(
    text=text,
    language="English",
    ref_audio=REF_AUDIO,
    ref_text=REF_TEXT,
    x_vector_only_mode=False,
    max_new_tokens=4096,        # Caps output length, prevents infinite loops
)

# ALWAYS set a per-scene timeout
import signal
MAX_SCENE_SECONDS = 300  # 5 min max per scene
signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, timeout_handler)
signal.alarm(MAX_SCENE_SECONDS)
# ... generate ...
signal.alarm(0)  # Cancel after success
```

Without `max_new_tokens`, the model can get stuck generating endlessly on certain inputs. This was discovered when a scene ran for 20+ minutes with no output. Adding `max_new_tokens=4096` fixed it immediately.

### Post-Generation: Convert WAV to MP3

Always convert WAV to MP3 before committing — reduces file size ~3x (82MB → 28MB per story):

```bash
cd stories/audio/[story-name]/
for f in *.wav; do
  ffmpeg -i "$f" -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k -y "${f%.wav}.mp3"
done
rm *.wav
```

Update the audio path in the story HTML from `.wav` to `.mp3`.

### Integrating Audio into the Story HTML

Add these to the story HTML:

1. **CSS** — Audio player styles (play button, progress bar, time display) matching the story's theme
2. **HTML** — Audio player element between the scene header and scene content
3. **JS Engine additions**:
   - `loadAudio(sceneId)` — Creates `new Audio()` with `src = audio/[story-name]/{sceneId}.mp3`
   - `stopAudio()` — Stops/resets on scene transitions and restart
   - `toggleAudio()` — Play/pause toggle with `.catch()` for browser autoplay restrictions
   - `seekAudio(e)` — Click-to-seek on progress bar
   - Progress update interval (250ms) for fill bar and time display

Hook into the existing engine:
- Call `stopAudio()` then `loadAudio(sceneId)` at the start of `renderScene()`
- Call `stopAudio()` in `restart()`
- Add event listeners in `init()`

Audio does NOT auto-play — it requires a user click. Handle missing audio files gracefully (hide the player on error).

## Parallel Creation Workflow

To create many stories at once:

### Phase 1: Research (Haiku agents in parallel)
For each style guide, spawn a Haiku agent to:
1. Read the style guide HTML (identify components and aesthetic)
2. Research the suggested historical topic using the **Wikipedia MCP server** (`wikipedia` tools: search articles, get summaries, pull sections for real dates/names/numbers)
3. Output a research brief (see format in Step 1 above)

> **Wikipedia MCP** is configured globally at `~/.claude/mcp.json`. Use it to get accurate historical facts — real dates, real names, real numbers. Training data alone is not reliable enough for educational content. Always prefer Wikipedia-sourced facts over recall.

### Phase 2: Create (Opus agents in parallel)
For each research brief, spawn an Opus agent to:
1. Read the research brief
2. Read the target style guide HTML for CSS/component reference
3. Read one existing story as a pattern reference (noir is the most complete)
4. Write the complete HTML story file
5. Validate: all choice targets have matching scene definitions, no orphan scenes

### Validation Checklist
After creation, verify each story:
- [ ] All `next:` targets point to defined scenes (or `_restart`)
- [ ] No unreachable scenes (except the start scene)
- [ ] DOCTYPE, html, head, body tags present and closed
- [ ] Google Fonts link included
- [ ] Keyboard support (1-9 keys) works
- [ ] Knowledge tracker updates with facts
- [ ] Title screen → start → scenes → ending → restart loop works
- [ ] At least 8 real historical facts with dates/numbers
- [ ] At least 2 meaningful choices (not just "continue")
- [ ] File saved as `stories/[style]-[title].html`
