## Key Historical Facts

1. **1930 - First Science Fiction Fanzine**: "The Comet," published by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago, became the first science-fiction fanzine and arguably the first fanzine in general, creating a template for fan-driven DIY publishing that would inspire decades of grassroots media.

2. **1940 - Birth of the Term "Fanzine"**: Russ Chauvenet coined the term "fanzine" in the October 1940 issue of his publication "Detours," distinguishing fan publications from professional "prozines" and establishing terminology that would define the independent publishing movement.

3. **1959 - Xerox 914 Commercial Photocopier Launch**: Xerox introduced the Xerox 914, the first successful commercial plain paper copier, on September 16, 1959, at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel in New York on live television—a technology that would revolutionize DIY publishing by making document duplication fast, economical, and accessible to ordinary people.

4. **1965 - Photocopier Economic Impact**: The Xerox 914 became one of the most successful products ever, accounting for two-thirds of Xerox's revenue in 1965 and generating $243 million in income, proving the massive market demand for affordable duplication technology.

5. **1976 (July 4) - Ramones at The Roundhouse**: Mark Perry, a 19-year-old bank clerk from South London, attended a transformative Ramones concert at The Roundhouse on July 4, 1976, which inspired him to create Britain's first punk fanzine just nine days later.

6. **1976 (July 13) - Sniffin' Glue Launch**: Mark Perry published the first issue of "Sniffin' Glue" on July 13, 1976, creating Britain's most influential punk zine with haphazard layout, felt-tip headlines, and deliberately non-existent grammar that captured punk's raw urgency and became a chronicle of early British punk rock.

7. **1976-1977 - Sniffin' Glue Growth**: Initial issues of Sniffin' Glue sold only 50 copies, but circulation rapidly increased to 15,000, demonstrating the hunger for authentic, grassroots punk journalism; the publication ran for 12 issues total before Perry ceased publication in 1977 to avoid mainstream music press absorption.

8. **1979-1985 - Desktop Publishing Revolution**: Desktop publishing technology began with TeX in 1978-1979, but truly emerged in 1985 with the Apple Macintosh, Apple's LaserWriter printer, and Aldus PageMaker software, democratizing layout and design for individual creators, small presses, and zine publishers.

9. **1988-1989 - Tobi Vail's Jigsaw Zine**: Tobi Vail published the first issue of her feminist zine "Jigsaw" in 1989 while working at an Olympia sandwich shop, pioneering the intersection of punk zines and explicit feminist discourse by focusing on "girls in bands" and aggressive feminist issues.

10. **1990 (October) - Bikini Kill Band Formation**: Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail, inspired by their zine collaborations, formed the band Bikini Kill in October 1990 with drummer Karren and bassist Kathi Wilcox, creating the sonic and ideological engine of the riot grrrl movement.

11. **1991 - Bikini Kill Zine and Riot Grrrl Manifesto**: Bikini Kill published zines in 1990 and 1991, with members creating the foundational "Riot Grrrl" zine in 1991 during a summer in Washington, D.C., collaborating with Allison Wolfe, Molly Neuman, and Jen Smith of Bratmobile to produce a manifesto that became a call to action for young women embracing feminism in punk rock.

12. **1997 - Lightning Source Print-on-Demand Founding**: Lightning Source was founded in La Vergne, Tennessee, as a subsidiary of Ingram Industries, pioneering print-on-demand technology that allowed self-publishers to avoid large upfront printing costs and democratized independent book publishing for the first time in history.

13. **2012 (London Book Fair) - Alliance of Independent Authors Launch**: The Alliance of Independent Authors (ALLi) was founded at the 2012 London Book Fair by Orna Ross and Philip Lynch, establishing a professional association for self-publishing authors that formalized the indie publishing movement begun by photocopied zines 36 years earlier.

## Dramatic Arc

**Setup (Scenes 1-3)**: The protagonist discovers a dusty risograph printer in a community art space and learns its history—from post-WWII duplication technology to underground punk aesthetics. Their first imperfect prints feel like rebellion. Touch points: Xerox 914 (1959), early photocopier culture, accessibility as radical.

**Rising Tension (Scenes 4-7)**: They dive into punk zine culture, encountering the raw DIY ethos of Sniffin' Glue (1976) and Mark Perry's 12-issue revolution. They start creating their own zine but feel constrained by punk's male-dominated scene. Ambition vs. belonging clash.

**Climax (Scene 8-9)**: Discovery of riot grrrl and Bikini Kill zines (1990-1991)—Tobi Vail and Kathleen Hanna's feminist reclamation of punk space through zines. A moment of recognition: they can claim both punk and feminism, both DIY and identity. The risograph becomes a tool for their voice.

**Resolution (Scenes 10-12)**: They publish their first 100-copy zine run, imperfections intact. Modern reflections on how POD technology (Lightning Source, 1997) and the Alliance of Independent Authors (2012) professionalized what started as photocopied rebellion. Full circle: punk's DIY spirit now validates mainstream publishing.

## Visual Notes

### Color Palette
- **Coral (#FF6B6B)**: Punk energy, bold declarations, 1970s urgency
- **Teal (#2EC4B6)**: Riot grrrl reclamation, feminist reclamation, 1990s cool
- **Yellow (#FFE66D)**: Accessibility, democratization, hope (desktop publishing era)
- **Pink (#FF006E)**: Feminine revolt, explicit riot grrrl identity, DIY defiance
- **Blue (#4361EE)**: Technology, innovation, POD and digital futures
- **Paper/Cream backgrounds**: Aged zine aesthetic, worn paper, history settling in

### Typography
- **Space Mono (headings/labels)**: Typewriter aesthetic, punk zine rawness, authorship
- **DM Sans (body)**: Readable but modern, respecting zine DIY while remaining accessible
- Scene quotes and dialogue in monospace to echo typed zine manifesto language

### Key CSS Effects to Leverage
1. **`.misregister`** - Use liberally in dialogue/manifesto sections; the offset effect mimics printing imperfections that became riot grrrl's aesthetic signature
2. **`.halftone`** - Apply to images/cards of zines or archival moments to create dot-matrix texture (1970s-1980s photocopier feel)
3. **Overlapping circles with `mix-blend-mode: multiply`** - Shows how ink colors layer and mix in risograph printing—metaphor for cultural movements blending (punk + feminism = riot grrrl)
4. **`.zine-border`** - Use between major scene transitions to echo physical zine page breaks and tape/staple aesthetic
5. **Offset shadows (`.btn::before`, `.card::before`)** - Every interactive element should feel slightly off-kilter, celebrating imperfection
6. **Paper grain overlay (pseudo-elements `body::before`, `body::after`)** - Constant texture reminds player they're reading a "printed" story, not sleek digital prose

### Animation Opportunities
- **`.wiggle:hover`** on zine card images or manifesto quotes—playful, slightly chaotic punk energy
- Fade-in for historical facts badges (like stamps being placed on the page)
- Subtle color bleed transitions when moving between eras (coral → teal as we transition punk → riot grrrl)
- Parallax on background ink circles to suggest depth of print layers
