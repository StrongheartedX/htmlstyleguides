# Pop Art Research Brief: Interactive Story

## Style: Pop Art
## Period: 1976-2025 Internet Meme History
## Story Concept: A museum curator is assembling "The Meme Museum" -- a four-room pop art gallery tracing the history of internet memes from Richard Dawkins's 1976 coinage through the AI slop era. The player chooses which memes to spotlight in each gallery room (era), with each room rendered in a different dominant color from the pop-art palette. The pop-art style is a perfect match because memes ARE pop art -- mass-produced, remixed, culturally commentary, and deliberately lowbrow turned iconic.

## Key Historical Facts

1. **1976**: Richard Dawkins coins the term "meme" in *The Selfish Gene*, derived from Ancient Greek *mimema* (imitated thing), shortened to parallel "gene" -- a unit of cultural replication analogous to biological genes.

2. **September 19, 1982, 11:44 AM**: Scott Fahlman at Carnegie Mellon University creates the first emoticons :-) and :-( in a bulletin board post, proposing them as joke markers for online communication.

3. **1990-1993**: Mike Godwin coins "Godwin's Law" on Usenet in 1990 (as Internet discussions grow longer, the probability of a Nazi comparison approaches 1). In 1993, he coins the term "Internet meme" -- one of the first uses of Dawkins's concept applied to viral digital content.

4. **1996**: The Dancing Baby (also called "Baby Cha-Cha") is created by Michael Girard and Robert Lurye as a 3D rendering demo, spreads via email chain letters, and appears on the TV show *Ally McBeal* -- widely considered the first viral internet meme.

5. **1998**: Deidre LaCarte creates the Hampster Dance website on GeoCities, featuring rows of animated hamster GIFs dancing to a sped-up sample of "Whistle Stop." The site goes from 800 total visits to 200,000 visits per day, becoming one of the first web page memes.

6. **1998-2001**: "All Your Base Are Belong to Us" originates from the badly translated 1989 Japanese video game *Zero Wing*. In February 2001, a Newgrounds video compiles the phrase photoshopped onto real-world signs and images, becoming one of the first remix memes.

7. **1999-2004**: Richard "Lowtax" Kyanka founds Something Awful in 1999 with its $10 registration fee forums. 4chan is founded October 1, 2003, by 15-year-old Christopher "moot" Poole. YTMND (You're The Man Now Dog) launches April 1, 2004, by Max Goldberg. These platforms become the foundational infrastructure for meme creation and distribution.

8. **2002-2005**: Star Wars Kid (Ghyslain Raza, age 14) becomes one of the first involuntary viral celebrities, accumulating over 1 billion estimated views. Numa Numa (Gary Brolsma, uploaded December 6, 2004, to Newgrounds) also surpasses 1 billion combined views. Chuck Norris Facts originate on Something Awful in early 2005, initially as "Vin Diesel Facts." The O RLY Owl (photo by John White, February 17, 2001; phrase from Something Awful) circulates 2003-2005.

9. **January 11, 2007**: Eric Nakagawa creates I Can Has Cheezburger, posting a cat image with misspelled caption from Something Awful. The site reaches 1.5 million daily hits at peak and is sold to Ben Huh's Cheezburger Network in September 2007 for $2 million, proving memes could be monetized.

10. **May 15, 2007**: Shawn Cotter posts the first Rickroll on 4chan's /v/ board, linking to Rick Astley's 1987 music video "Never Gonna Give You Up" as a bait-and-switch. The video has since accumulated over 1.6 billion YouTube views. Chocolate Rain by Tay Zonday (April 22, 2007) reaches 140 million+ views. "Leave Britney Alone" by Chris Crocker (September 2007) gets 2 million views in 24 hours.

11. **2008-2009**: Rage Comics debut on 4chan's /b/ board in August 2008, spawning the f7u12 subreddit in January 2009. Trollface is drawn by Carlos Ramirez, age 18, in MS Paint on September 19, 2008, eventually earning him over $100,000 in licensing fees. Advice Dog appears September 7, 2006, and memegenerator.net launches March 2009, enabling the explosion of image macros and Advice Animals.

12. **2011-2012**: Nyan Cat by Christopher Torres (April 2, 2011) reaches 205 million+ views. Gangnam Style by PSY (released July 15, 2012) becomes the first YouTube video to reach 1 billion views on December 21, 2012, now exceeding 5 billion. Grumpy Cat (Tardar Sauce, posted September 22, 2012) gets 1 million+ Imgur views in 48 hours. Know Your Meme, founded December 2007 by Kenyatta Cheese and colleagues at Rocketboom, becomes the definitive meme encyclopedia.

13. **2013-2016**: Vine launches January 24, 2013, with its 6-second format reaching 200 million users before shutting down January 17, 2017. The Ice Bucket Challenge (summer 2014) raises $115 million for ALS research with 17 million videos and 10 billion views. "The Dress" (February 2015) gets 37 million+ BuzzFeed views. Pepe the Frog (created by Matt Furie in 2005, adopted by 4chan in 2008) is designated an ADL hate symbol in September 2016. Harambe (Cincinnati Zoo, May 28, 2016) becomes "2016's meme of the year." Doge (Kabosu the Shiba Inu, photo February 13, 2010) explodes late 2013 as the #1 meme of the 2010s decade.

14. **2018-2019**: TikTok launches internationally in August 2018 after the Musical.ly merger. The Area 51 raid event (June 27, 2019, created by Matty Roberts) gets 2 million RSVPs but only ~150 show up. Woman Yelling at Cat (May 1, 2019) earns 78,000 retweets and 275,000 likes. "OK Boomer" goes viral on TikTok in October 2019, punctuated by New Zealand MP Chloe Swarbrick using it in Parliament. Baby Yoda (November 12, 2019) generates 2 million tweets in its first 3 weeks.

15. **2020-2025**: COVID memes explode March 2020 (Tiger King, sourdough, #FlattenTheCurve). Among Us peaks at 60 million daily active players in September 2020. The Coffin Dance/Astronomia meme featuring Ghana pallbearers (Benjamin Aidoo) goes viral in March 2020. Bernie Mittens (January 20, 2021, photo by Brendan Smialowski, mittens by Jen Ellis) raises $1.8 million for charity. GameStop (January 2021, Keith Gill "DeepFuckingValue") drives stock from $17 to $483. Grimace Shake (June 2023, first video by Austin Frazier) hits 2.9 billion TikTok views and boosts McDonald's sales 10%. Skibidi Toilet (February 7, 2023, by Alexey Gerasimov) reaches 65 billion+ total views. "Brain Rot" becomes Oxford Word of the Year 2024 with 230% usage increase. Moo Deng the pygmy hippo (September 2024) doubles zoo visitors and generates $533,000 in ticket revenue in 2 weeks. "AI Slop" (coined by Simon Willison, May 2024) becomes the dominant concern; "Slop" is named Merriam-Webster Word of the Year 2025. The TikTok ban is upheld by the Supreme Court on January 17, 2025, with Trump postponing enforcement by 75 days.

## Dramatic Arc

**Setup (Scenes 1-3)**: The player arrives at an empty museum on opening night. They are the newly hired curator of "The Meme Museum," and the galleries are blank -- four rooms, each representing a different era, each needing exhibits. A speech bubble introduces the concept: memes are the pop art of the internet age, mass-produced cultural units that Dawkins named in 1976. The player learns they must choose which memes to spotlight, because you can never show everything -- curation IS the art.

**Rising Action (Scenes 4-8)**: The player moves through the first three gallery rooms (Pre-2005, 2006-2012, 2013-2019), making choices about which memes to feature. Each room has a different pop-art color scheme and presents branching decisions: Do you spotlight the grassroots creativity of early forums, or the first viral sensations? Do you focus on the commercialization of meme culture (LOLcats selling for $2M) or the anarchic energy of 4chan and Rickrolling? Do you highlight how memes became political tools (Pepe, OK Boomer) or how they raised real money (Ice Bucket Challenge, GameStop)?

**Climax (Scenes 9-11)**: The final gallery room (2020-2025) forces the hardest curatorial decisions. Memes have become a $6.1 billion industry. TikTok is simultaneously the most powerful meme platform in history and facing a government ban. "Brain Rot" is Oxford's Word of the Year. AI-generated "slop" threatens to drown authentic meme culture. The player must decide what the museum's thesis will be: Are memes humanity's most democratic art form, or have they been co-opted and corrupted?

**Resolution (Scenes 12-14)**: The museum opens to the public. Based on the player's curatorial choices throughout, the exhibition tells one of three stories -- and the critics respond accordingly. The pop-art framing pays off: just as Warhol asked "Is a soup can art?", the player has answered "Are memes art?"

## Scene Outline

**Scene 1: `museum_opening_night`** | "THE MEME MUSEUM // OPENING NIGHT"
*Setup*: The player arrives at a bold, brightly lit museum. Four empty gallery rooms stretch ahead, each painted a different pop-art color. A speech bubble introduces the concept: "Memes are the pop art of the internet. Mass-produced. Remixed. Endlessly replicated. Tonight, you decide what goes on these walls." The player learns they are the curator. Facts introduced: Richard Dawkins coined "meme" in *The Selfish Gene* (1976), from Greek *mimema*. Mike Godwin coined "Internet meme" in 1993.
No choices -- pure exposition and atmosphere setting.

**Scene 2: `gallery_one_origins`** | "GALLERY 1: THE PRIMORDIAL SOUP // PRE-2005"
*Rising Action*: The first room is dominated by pop-red. The player surveys the Pre-2005 era: Scott Fahlman's emoticons (September 19, 1982), Dancing Baby (1996), Hampster Dance (1998, from 800 to 200,000 daily visits), All Your Base (1998-2001, Newgrounds February 2001). Platform cards profile Something Awful (1999, Lowtax, $10 fee), 4chan (October 1, 2003, moot age 15), and YTMND (April 1, 2004). Star Wars Kid (Ghyslain Raza, 1B+ views), Numa Numa (Gary Brolsma, December 6, 2004, 1B+ views), Chuck Norris Facts (early 2005, originally Vin Diesel Facts on Something Awful), and O RLY Owl are all available as exhibits.
**Choice A**: "Focus on the pioneers -- the first viral sensations that proved the internet could make anything famous" -> `viral_pioneers`
**Choice B**: "Focus on the platforms -- the forums and imageboards that built the meme factory" -> `platform_builders`

**Scene 3: `viral_pioneers`** | "THE FIRST FAMOUS THINGS ON THE INTERNET // 1996-2005"
*Branch A deepens*: The player curates a room spotlighting the memes themselves. Dancing Baby gets the Warhol treatment (four-panel card in pink/yellow/cyan/orange). Hampster Dance is presented as the first web-native meme (GeoCities origin, Deidre LaCarte). All Your Base demonstrates the first remix culture. Star Wars Kid raises the first ethical questions about involuntary virality (Ghyslain Raza, age 14). A speech bubble muses: "These weren't made by professionals. They were accidents, inside jokes, bad translations. That's what made them revolutionary."
No choice -- exhibition immersion scene.

**Scene 4: `platform_builders`** | "WHERE MEMES WERE BORN // 1999-2004"
*Branch B deepens*: The player curates a room spotlighting the infrastructure. Something Awful gets a Lichtenstein card (bold red halftone header: "THE $10 PAYWALL"). 4chan gets a comic-panel card emphasizing anonymous culture and moot's credit-card-funded origin story. YTMND gets a profile card. An alert-info box explains how these platforms created the conditions for meme culture: anonymity encouraged experimentation, low barriers enabled mass participation, and the lack of algorithms meant content spread organically.
No choice -- exhibition immersion scene.

**Scene 5: `gallery_two_golden_age`** | "GALLERY 2: THE GOLDEN AGE // 2006-2012"
*Convergence Point*: Both branches arrive here. The second room is dominated by pop-yellow. This is the golden age of memes: LOLcats/I Can Has Cheezburger (January 11, 2007, Eric Nakagawa, sold for $2M, 1.5M daily hits), Rickrolling (May 15, 2007, Shawn Cotter on 4chan, Rick Astley video now 1.6B views), Chocolate Rain (Tay Zonday, April 22, 2007, 140M+ views), "Leave Britney Alone" (Chris Crocker, September 2007, 2M views in 24 hours), Rage Comics (August 2008, Trollface by Carlos Ramirez earning $100k+ in licensing), Advice Animals (memegenerator.net March 2009), Nyan Cat (April 2, 2011, 205M+ views), Gangnam Style (PSY, July 15, 2012, first to 1B YouTube views December 21, 2012), Grumpy Cat (Tardar Sauce, September 22, 2012, 1M Imgur views in 48 hours), Doge (Kabosu the Shiba Inu, photo February 13, 2010, explosion late 2013), and Know Your Meme (December 2007, Kenyatta Cheese et al.).
**Choice C**: "Spotlight the moment memes became money -- LOLcats, Trollface licensing, the Cheezburger Network empire" -> `memes_become_money`
**Choice D**: "Spotlight the anarchic creativity -- Rickrolling, Rage Comics, Nyan Cat, the beautiful absurdity of it all" -> `beautiful_absurdity`

**Scene 6: `memes_become_money`** | "WHEN MEMES GOT A PRICE TAG // 2007-2012"
*Branch C*: The player builds an exhibit on meme commercialization. A data table shows the financials: I Can Has Cheezburger sold for $2M (September 2007), Trollface earned $100k+ in licensing, Grumpy Cat became a brand generating millions. Gangnam Style gets the starburst button treatment -- "FIRST TO 1 BILLION!" An alert-warning notes the tension: "When a meme becomes a product, does it stop being a meme?" Know Your Meme (acquired by Cheezburger Network March 28, 2011) gets profiled as the institution that tried to catalog the uncatalogable.
No choice -- exhibition immersion scene.

**Scene 7: `beautiful_absurdity`** | "THE GOLDEN AGE OF WEIRD // 2007-2012"
*Branch D*: The player builds an exhibit celebrating pure creative chaos. Rickrolling gets the Warhol treatment. Nyan Cat loops endlessly in a comic panel. Rage Comics are presented as the internet's first native art form -- MS Paint as the new silkscreen. A speech bubble reflects: "Nobody was trying to go viral. Nobody was building a brand. They were just being weird on the internet, and the internet loved them for it." Keyboard Cat (1984 video, viral 2009, Charlie Schmidt's cat Fatso) appears as a surprise bonus exhibit.
No choice -- exhibition immersion scene.

**Scene 8: `gallery_three_mainstream`** | "GALLERY 3: THE MAINSTREAM ERA // 2013-2019"
*Rising Action continues*: The third room is dominated by pop-blue. Memes go mainstream and political. Vine (January 24, 2013, 6-second format, 200M users, acquired by Twitter for $30M, shut down January 17, 2017) reshaped meme grammar. The Ice Bucket Challenge (summer 2014, $115M raised, 17M videos, 10B views) proved memes could change the world. The Dress (February 2015, 37M+ BuzzFeed views) divided humanity over color perception. Pepe the Frog (Matt Furie 2005, 4chan 2008, ADL hate symbol September 2016) showed memes could be weaponized. Harambe (May 28, 2016) became "2016's meme of the year." Distracted Boyfriend (Antonio Guillem, 2017, Best Meme Shorty Awards) became the decade's most versatile template. TikTok launched internationally August 2018. Area 51 raid (June 27, 2019, Matty Roberts, 2M RSVPs, ~150 showed up). Woman Yelling at Cat (May 1, 2019, 78k retweets, 275k likes). OK Boomer (October 2019, NZ MP Chloe Swarbrick). Baby Yoda (November 12, 2019, 2M tweets in 3 weeks). Damn Daniel (February 15, 2016, Joshua Holz, 45M views in days).
**Choice E**: "Spotlight how memes became political and dangerous -- Pepe, OK Boomer, the weaponization of humor" -> `memes_go_political`
**Choice F**: "Spotlight how memes became a force for good -- Ice Bucket Challenge, charity, community building" -> `memes_for_good`

**Scene 9: `memes_go_political`** | "WHEN MEMES GOT SERIOUS // 2016-2019"
*Branch E*: The player builds a provocative exhibit. Pepe the Frog gets a Lichtenstein card with the full arc: Matt Furie's innocent 2005 comic character, adopted by 4chan in 2008, ADL hate symbol designation September 2016. An alert-error box marks the controversy. OK Boomer is presented as generational warfare distilled into two words. Harambe gets a speech bubble reflecting on grief, absurdity, and how the internet mourns. The exhibit asks hard questions about irony, radicalization, and whether memes can be reclaimed once co-opted.
**Choice G**: "The museum's thesis should be: Memes are a mirror -- they reflect whatever we put into them" -> `gallery_four_now` (with political lens flag)
**Choice H**: "The museum's thesis should be: Memes are a weapon -- and we need to understand who wields them" -> `gallery_four_now` (with weapon lens flag)

**Scene 10: `memes_for_good`** | "MEMES THAT CHANGED THE WORLD // 2014-2019"
*Branch F*: The player builds an optimistic exhibit. The Ice Bucket Challenge dominates the room: $115 million raised for ALS, 17 million videos, 10 billion views. A data table shows the numbers. Vine is celebrated as the most democratic creative platform ever -- 6 seconds, no budget required, 200 million users. The Dress is framed as a meme that united the world in harmless debate. Baby Yoda represents pure wholesome joy. A speech bubble reflects: "For every dark meme, there are a thousand that just made someone laugh at their desk."
**Choice I**: "The museum's thesis should be: Memes are humanity's most democratic art form" -> `gallery_four_now` (with art lens flag)
**Choice J**: "The museum's thesis should be: Memes connect us -- they're the shared language of the internet generation" -> `gallery_four_now` (with connection lens flag)

**Scene 11: `gallery_four_now`** | "GALLERY 4: THE NOW // 2020-2025"
*Climax*: The final room is dominated by pop-pink. This is the most chaotic room. COVID memes (March 2020, Tiger King, sourdough, #FlattenTheCurve) showed how humor became a coping mechanism during crisis. Among Us peaked at 60 million daily active players September 2020. Coffin Dance/Astronomia (Ghana pallbearers, Benjamin Aidoo, March 2020) turned death itself into a meme. Bernie Mittens (January 20, 2021, Brendan Smialowski photo, Jen Ellis mittens, $1.8M charity) became the last truly wholesome viral moment. GameStop (January 2021, Keith Gill "DeepFuckingValue", stock $17 to $483) proved memes could move billions in real money. Sea Shanty TikTok (December 2020-January 2021, Nathan Evans "Wellerman", #1 UK Singles). Grimace Shake (June 2023, Austin Frazier, 2.9B TikTok views, McDonald's sales up 10%). Barbenheimer (July 21, 2023). Skibidi Toilet (February 7, 2023, Alexey Gerasimov, 65B+ total views). "Brain Rot" named Oxford Word of the Year 2024 (230% usage increase). Moo Deng the pygmy hippo (September 2024, doubled zoo visitors, $533k ticket revenue in 2 weeks). AI Slop (coined Simon Willison May 2024, "Slop" named Merriam-Webster Word of the Year 2025). TikTok ban upheld by Supreme Court January 17, 2025, Trump postpones 75 days.
**Choice K**: "End the exhibit with hope -- memes will always find a way, even if TikTok falls" -> `ending_hope`
**Choice L**: "End the exhibit with a warning -- AI slop and brain rot threaten everything memes once were" -> `ending_warning`

**Scene 12: `ending_hope`** | "THE MEME MUSEUM: GRAND OPENING // THE FUTURE"
*Ending 1 -- The Optimist's Museum*: The museum opens to rave reviews. Critics call it "a love letter to internet creativity." The final wall of the exhibit reads: "From Dawkins's cultural gene to Skibidi Toilet's 65 billion views, memes are proof that human creativity cannot be contained. They evolve. They adapt. They survive. Just like the genes they were named after." The player's curatorial choices are summarized. A starburst button declares: "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 seconds." (A riff on Warhol's quote, updated for the meme age.) An alert-success confirms: the Meme Museum is a hit.
**Replay choices**: "Curate again" -> `museum_opening_night` | "Back to Stories" -> `_exit`

**Scene 13: `ending_warning`** | "THE MEME MUSEUM: GRAND OPENING // THE RECKONING"
*Ending 2 -- The Critic's Museum*: The museum opens to polarized reactions. Some critics praise its honesty. Others call it "doom-scrolling turned into an art exhibit." The final wall reads: "In 2024, Oxford named 'Brain Rot' its Word of the Year. In 2025, Merriam-Webster chose 'Slop.' The meme, once the purest expression of internet creativity, now risks drowning in algorithmically generated noise. The question is no longer 'Are memes art?' The question is: 'Are they still human?'" An alert-warning notes the global meme industry is now worth $6.1 billion. The TikTok ban looms.
**Replay choices**: "Curate again" -> `museum_opening_night` | "Back to Stories" -> `_exit`

**Scene 14: `ending_balanced`** | "THE MEME MUSEUM: GRAND OPENING // THE FULL PICTURE"
*Ending 3 -- The Balanced Museum* (reached by mixing political/good choices across branches): The museum opens as the most-discussed cultural event of the season. It presents memes as neither purely good nor purely dangerous, but as the most significant cultural phenomenon of the internet age. The final wall reads: "Andy Warhol said art is what you can get away with. By that definition, the internet has been the greatest art studio in human history. 65 billion views for a toilet with a head. $115 million raised with a bucket of ice. A frog that went from comic book to hate symbol to crypto currency. This is us. All of us. And it's beautiful, and terrible, and absolutely, unmistakably pop art." An alert-info box notes: the global meme industry reached $6.1 billion in 2025, up from $2.3 billion in 2020.
**Replay choices**: "Curate again" -> `museum_opening_night` | "Back to Stories" -> `_exit`

- **Primary Colors**: Red (#E2190C), Yellow (#FFD819), Blue (#0057B8), Hot Pink (#FF1493), Orange (#FF6B1A)
- **Supporting Colors**: Cyan (#00C8FF), Green (#39B54A), Purple (#9B30FF), Black (#1A1A1A), Cream (#FFF8E7)
- **Background**: Cream (#FFF8E7) with Ben-Day dot pattern overlay

### Era-Specific Color Dominance
- **Gallery 1 (Pre-2005)**: Pop-red dominant -- the raw, unrefined era of early internet
- **Gallery 2 (2006-2012)**: Pop-yellow dominant -- the golden age, bright and optimistic
- **Gallery 3 (2013-2019)**: Pop-blue dominant -- memes go mainstream, deeper and more complex
- **Gallery 4 (2020-2025)**: Pop-pink dominant -- chaotic, intense, emotionally charged

### Fonts
- **Bangers** (display): Comic-book energy for museum signage, meme names, and exclamations -- perfect for titles like "RICKROLLED!" and "FIRST TO 1 BILLION!"
- **Lilita One** (headings): Gallery room names and section headers -- bold and authoritative for the museum setting
- **Roboto** (body): Clean and readable for historical exposition, dates, statistics, and curator narration

### CSS Effects to Leverage
- **Ben-Day Dots** (`body::before`, `.halftone-overlay`): Constant halftone pattern reinforcing the pop-art/print aesthetic -- memes are mass-produced, just like screen prints
- **Comic-Panel Borders** (`.comic-panel`, 4px solid black + 6px box-shadow): Frame each scene as a comic panel, emphasizing the visual storytelling parallel between comics and memes
- **Speech Bubbles** (`.speech-bubble`): Curator's inner monologue and reflections, with the classic comic tail pointing down
- **Starburst Clip-Path** (`.btn-burst`, `.header-burst`): "POW!" moments for major revelations -- first billion views, first meme sold for money, Skibidi Toilet's 65 billion views
- **Thick Black Borders** (4-5px solid, pervasive): Everything has bold outlines, matching both the pop-art aesthetic and the graphic quality of meme templates
- **Box-Shadow Offset** (4-6px solid black): Gives depth and visual weight to cards and buttons, mimicking screen-print misregistration
- **Color Block Hover Scale** (`.color-block:hover` scale 1.08): Interactive feel for meme selection moments
- **Warhol Grid** (`.card-warhol`, 2x2 grid with four color cells): Perfect for showing how memes get repeated and remixed in different contexts -- the Warhol treatment applied to memes
- **Divider Stripes** (`.divider`, repeating-linear-gradient in red/yellow/blue/pink/orange): Pop-art scene transitions between eras

### Scene-Specific Visual Approaches

**Scene 1** (Museum Opening): Full pop-art header treatment with starburst. Clean cream background. Minimal content -- just the museum entrance and the core thesis. Speech bubble introduces the curator's voice.

**Scenes 2-4** (Gallery 1 / Pre-2005): Red-dominant backgrounds and borders. Cards styled with red top-borders for meme profiles. Lichtenstein cards for platforms. The visual feel should be raw and crude -- matching the low-resolution era of GeoCities and early forums. Alert-info boxes provide historical context.

**Scenes 5-7** (Gallery 2 / 2006-2012): Yellow-dominant. This is the brightest, most exuberant room. Warhol repeat cards for iconic memes. Comic-panel cards for the absurdist memes. Data tables for commercial milestones. The visual feel is joyful and chaotic -- peak internet creativity.

**Scenes 8-10** (Gallery 3 / 2013-2019): Blue-dominant. Cooler, more serious tone. Alert-warning boxes appear for the first time (Pepe controversy, political weaponization). Lichtenstein cards present the duality of memes as both creative and destructive. The visual shift signals maturation and complexity.

**Scenes 11-14** (Gallery 4 / 2020-2025 + Endings): Pink-dominant. Maximum visual intensity. Alert-error boxes for crisis moments (AI slop, TikTok ban, brain rot). Starburst buttons for the astronomical numbers (65B views, $6.1B industry). The endings use the footer aesthetic -- dark background with colored text -- to create a sense of finality and reflection.

### Interactive Elements
- **Buttons** (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-accent`): Player choices styled as museum touchscreen buttons with thick borders and satisfying hover animations (translate -2px, box-shadow grows)
- **Cards**: Meme profiles as standard cards with colored top-borders; platforms as Lichtenstein cards; iconic memes given the Warhol 4-panel treatment
- **Badges**: Color-coded metadata -- yellow for dates, blue for platforms, red for milestones, pink for creators, orange for financial figures
- **Alerts**: Context boxes (info for history, success for completions, warning for controversies, error for crises)
- **Speech Bubbles**: Curator's voice throughout -- personal, reflective, occasionally funny, always grounded in real facts
- **Action Words**: Pop-art exclamations ("VIRAL!", "BANNED!", "TRENDING!", "SOLD!") at key dramatic moments

### Suggested Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain Images
- Dancing Baby: widely reproduced 3D render, public domain status debatable -- use text description with halftone effect instead
- O RLY Owl: Original photo by John White (February 17, 2001), search Wikimedia Commons for "Northern Saw-whet Owl"
- Trollface: Copyrighted by Carlos Ramirez -- do not use image, reference in text only
- Rick Astley "Never Gonna Give You Up": Use a stylized text-based recreation ("You know the rules...")
- Grumpy Cat / Doge / Nyan Cat: All copyrighted -- use text descriptions styled as pop-art cards
- For general illustration: Use CSS-generated pop-art patterns (Ben-Day dots, color blocks, speech bubbles) rather than copyrighted meme images
