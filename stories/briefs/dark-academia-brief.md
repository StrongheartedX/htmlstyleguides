## Key Historical Facts

1. **Oxford University's First Teaching (1096)** - Though no clear founding date exists, teaching was documented at Oxford in 1096, making it one of Europe's oldest continuous universities.

2. **Henry II's Student Ban (1167)** - King Henry II of England banned all English students from attending the University of Paris following his conflict with Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. This expulsion prompted scholars to establish Oxford as a major academic center.

3. **Oxford's Rapid Growth (1167-1209)** - Following the Paris ban, Oxford grew explosively from 50 scholars to an estimated 3,000 students by 1209, becoming one of Europe's most prestigious universities.

4. **The 1209 Student Murder Crisis** - Two students were killed by Oxford townspeople, prompting scholars to abandon the city and threatening to close the university entirely. This crisis led to the first formal written privileges for students.

5. **Oxford Ordinance (June 20, 1214)** - A Papal Legate issued this decree granting scholars extraordinary legal privileges, including exemption from civil law through "benefit of clergy," protected housing with controlled rent, and placement of the university Chancellor above town authority. This ordinance formalized student rights beyond ordinary citizens.

6. **University College, First College (1249)** - William of Durham died in 1249, bequeathing 310 marks to support Oxford scholars. This endowment established the first college system, transforming Oxford from informal gatherings into structured residential colleges.

7. **Balliol College Founded (1263)** - John I de Balliol founded this college in 1263, which later became consolidated by his widow Dervorguilla of Galloway in 1282. Balliol claims to be among the oldest colleges in the English-speaking world.

8. **Roger Bacon at Oxford (c. 1219-1292)** - This Franciscan friar and polymath studied and lectured at Oxford, pioneering the scientific method and advancing empiricism. Bacon was imprisoned between 1277-1279 by his fellow Franciscans for "suspected novelties" in his teaching—forbidden knowledge.

9. **Duns Scotus's Subtle Philosophy (1266-1308)** - Born December 23, 1265 or March 17, 1266, this Franciscan scholar taught at Oxford and became "Doctor Subtilis" (Subtle Doctor) for his groundbreaking theories of individuality and being. His work challenged Aquinas's dominance and influenced 14th-century thought.

10. **St Scholastica Day Riot (February 10, 1355)** - A dispute over bad wine in a tavern escalated into a three-day violent conflict between townspeople and university scholars. Armed gangs from the countryside attacked student halls; reports describe scalping of scholars. Approximately 20 townspeople and up to 63 university members were killed, marking the climax of 146 years of town-gown tensions.

11. **William of Ockham's Nominalism (c. 1287-1347)** - This Oxford theologian pioneered nominalism and empiricism, arguing only individuals exist, not universal essences. Ockham's radical philosophy challenged institutional authority and predetermined church doctrine, making him a figure of intellectual rebellion.

12. **The Index of Prohibited Books (1751)** - During the Enlightenment, the Catholic Church's Index Librorum Prohibitorum and the University of Paris's Faculty of Theology (Sorbonne) banned works by Enlightenment philosophers including Montesquieu's *Spirit of the Laws* (1751). Encyclopedic knowledge itself became forbidden, illustrating the centuries-long battle over censorship that originated in medieval universities.

## Dramatic Arc

**Setup (Scenes 1-2):** Scholar arrives at Oxford's oldest college during a winter night, seeking a forbidden manuscript mentioned in cipher. Atmospheric immersion in candlelit halls, dust-covered shelves, and the weight of 500 years of secrets.

**Rising Tension (Scenes 3-6):** Encounters with a mysterious librarian, discovery of a secret society's meeting place, realization that the manuscript details dangerous theological ideas banned by both church and university. Must navigate between helping discovery and self-preservation. Flashbacks to Roger Bacon and Ockham's imprisonment haunt the narrative.

**Climax (Scenes 7-9):** Found by university authorities (the Chancellor's men) in the manuscript hall. Choice: destroy the forbidden book or risk arrest. If choosing to protect the book, must flee through underground passages, mirroring medieval scholars' actual escapes.

**Resolution (Scenes 10-12):** Either scholar escapes with knowledge (accepting exile/danger) or compromises with authority (knowledge suppressed but scholar safe). Final scene reflects on cost of truth-seeking through 700 years of Oxford's intellectual battles.

## Visual Notes

### Color Palette Application

- **Primary Background (#2A1A0A - Brown Dark):** Candlelit library interiors, late-night scenes, sense of secrecy and introspection
- **Secondary Background (#3D2914 - Umber):** College halls, institutional authority spaces, warmer but still oppressive
- **Text Primary (#F4F1E8 - Parchment):** All readable text on dark backgrounds, mimicking old manuscript experience
- **Accent Gold (#B8860B - Antique Gold):** Highlights forbidden knowledge reveals, important historical facts, precious manuscripts
- **Burgundy (#722F37):** Danger markers, choices with serious consequences, violence (St Scholastica Riot scenes)
- **Forest (#2D4A3E):** Authority figures, institutional power, calm but controlling presence
- **Gold Muted (#9A7B4F):** Historical cards, dividers between scenes, transitions through time

### Typography in Narrative

- **Display Font (Cormorant Garamond Italic):** Scene titles, forbidden manuscript headers, dramatic revelations
- **Heading Font (EB Garamond):** Major narrative divisions, character introductions, historical figures
- **Body Font (Source Serif 4):** Main narrative text, scholarly dialogue, internal monologue

### Special CSS Effects to Leverage

1. **`.texture-bg` with fractal noise:** Creates aged parchment appearance; intensify opacity for closer examination of forbidden texts
2. **`.vignette` radial gradient:** Darkens edges during tense scenes, creates intimate "candlelight" focus on critical choices
3. **`.ornate-divider`:** Mark century transitions (1200s → 1300s → 1700s); create visual time jumps
4. **`.manuscript` class with left border line:** Frame actual forbidden text passages; evoke medieval manuscript aesthetic
5. **`.dropcap` large burgundy letter:** Open each major discovery scene; signal importance of moment
6. **`.page-frame` with inset shadows:** Flashback scenes showing Roger Bacon, Ockham, Duns Scotus; frame historical context
7. **`.blockquote` with burgundy left border:** Display forbidden thoughts, dangerous ideas, intellectual rebellion
8. **Smooth transitions (0.4s ease):** Button hover effects signify weight of choices; dragging cursor feels intentional
9. **`.badge-burgundy` background:** Mark "dangerous path" choices visually throughout story
10. **`.shadow-glow` effect on cards:** Highlight historical figures and dramatic moments with subtle luminescence

### Atmospheric Recommendations

- **Night scenes:** Reduce color saturation, increase gold/amber accent lighting
- **Discovery moments:** Increase parchment text opacity, slight glow on gold accents
- **Danger sequences:** Flash burgundy accents, increase vignette darkness
- **Flashback scenes:** Overlay slight sepia tone, use page-frame styling extensively
- **Safe choices:** Increase forest green emphasis, maintain stability
- **Rebellious choices:** Increase burgundy presence, add visual instability (slight rotation, shadow shifts)
