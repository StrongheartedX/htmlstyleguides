## Key Historical Facts

1. **Newton's Prism Experiment (1666)**: Sir Isaac Newton conducted his groundbreaking prism experiment in 1666, using a glass prism to disperse a beam of sunlight into a spectrum of colors. He completely darkened his study, created a small hole in the window shutters, and observed that white light was composed of all colors from red to violet, with each color having different wavelengths that bent at different angles when passing through the prism.

2. **William Herschel Discovers Infrared (March 27, 1800)**: British astronomer William Herschel discovered infrared radiation while measuring the heating effects of different colors in the solar spectrum. Using a prism to create a spectrum and thermometers to measure temperature, he found that heat intensity increased from blue toward red and continued beyond the red end, which he called "calorific rays" or "radiant heat" in his paper presented to the Royal Society.

3. **Johann Wilhelm Ritter Discovers Ultraviolet (February 22, 1801)**: German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter discovered ultraviolet radiation just one year after Herschel's infrared discovery. Inspired by Herschel's work, Ritter searched for an opposite "cooling" radiation at the violet end of the spectrum and discovered that silver chloride darkened faster when placed beyond the violet light, creating what he called "Chemical Rays," later renamed ultraviolet light.

4. **Heinrich Hertz Detects Radio Waves (November 1887)**: German physicist Heinrich Hertz conducted a series of experiments starting in November 1887 that proved Maxwell's theory of electromagnetic waves. Using a dipole antenna with a 30-killovolt spark gap and a resonant receiver loop, Hertz demonstrated that these electromagnetic waves traveled in straight lines, could be focused and refracted, and moved at the speed of light—establishing the existence of radio waves.

5. **Wilhelm Röntgen Discovers X-rays (November 8, 1895)**: German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays accidentally while experimenting with cathode-ray tubes. While studying fluorescence in a partially evacuated glass tube, he noticed that a distant screen of barium platinocyanide glowed when the tube was activated. After seven weeks of research, Röntgen documented that these rays penetrated flesh but cast shadows from bones, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for this discovery.

6. **Dennis Gabor Invents Holography (1947)**: Hungarian-British physicist Dennis Gabor invented holography in 1947 while working at British Thomson-Houston. His concept of "wavefront reconstruction" was initially developed to improve electron microscope performance but laid the theoretical foundation for three-dimensional imaging through recorded light interference patterns. Though the invention was revolutionary, practical implementation had to await the development of coherent light sources.

7. **Percy Spencer Discovers Microwave Heating (1945)**: American engineer Percy Spencer, working for Raytheon Company, discovered the heating properties of microwaves in 1945 when he noticed a candy bar in his pocket had melted while he was testing an active magnetron. Spencer, who had previously improved magnetron manufacturing efficiency to 2,600 units per day, filed the first patent for a microwave oven on October 8, 1945, later calling his invention the "Radarange."

8. **Theodore Maiman Builds the First Laser (May 16, 1960)**: American engineer and physicist Theodore Maiman created the first functional laser at Hughes' Malibu, California laboratories on May 16, 1960. Using a synthetic pink ruby rod measuring 1 cm by 1.5 cm as the active laser medium and a helical xenon flash lamp as the excitation source, Maiman produced the first coherent light beam—all wavelengths in phase and moving in the same direction. He published his results in Nature on August 6, 1960, and announced the laser to the world on July 7, 1960.

9. **Birth of Practical Holography (1962-1964)**: American optical engineers Emmett Leith and Juris Upatnieks at the University of Michigan created the first three-dimensional holograms in the United States using laser light. They demonstrated their breakthrough at the Spring 1964 meeting of the Optical Society of America, displaying the world's first 3-D hologram of a toy train—the first practical demonstration of Dennis Gabor's 1947 theoretical invention, made possible only after Maiman's 1960 laser breakthrough.

10. **Laser Coherence Breakthrough (August 6, 1960)**: Theodore Maiman's publication of his laser discovery in the prestigious journal Nature on August 6, 1960 (after initial rejections) marked the moment when the scientific community accepted the reality of coherent light generation. This publication transformed optical physics and made possible the practical realization of holography that had been theoretically conceived 13 years earlier, requiring a coherent light source that Gabor's original work lacked.

11. **Radio Wave Frequency Measurement**: Heinrich Hertz's 1887-1889 experiments proved that electromagnetic waves traveled at approximately 300,000 kilometers per second (the speed of light), establishing that radio waves, light waves, infrared rays, and ultraviolet rays were all part of the same electromagnetic spectrum. His findings unified optical theory with electrical phenomena and established the theoretical foundation for understanding all radiation from radio to gamma rays.

12. **The Electromagnetic Spectrum Completion (1895-1960)**: The discovery sequence from Newton's visible spectrum (1666) through infrared (1800), ultraviolet (1801), radio waves (1887), and X-rays (1895) established that human vision captured only a tiny fraction of electromagnetic radiation. By 1960, when Maiman created the laser, scientists understood the entire electromagnetic spectrum from low-frequency radio waves to high-frequency gamma rays, each with different wavelengths, frequencies, and interactions with matter—a unified framework that made holography possible.

## Dramatic Arc

**Setup (Scenes 1-3)**: The story opens in 1666 with Newton in his darkened study, discovering that white light contains all colors. The player learns that visible light is just one small part of something larger. Tension builds as we learn that invisible light exists but cannot yet be measured.

**Rising Tension (Scenes 4-6)**: Herschel (1800) discovers heat beyond red light, and immediately Ritter (1801) finds chemical rays beyond violet. The spectrum is expanding. The player realizes there's an entire invisible world around us. Then Hertz (1887) and Röntgen (1895) discover even more strange radiations—waves in empty space, rays that pass through flesh.

**Climax (Scenes 7-9)**: Jump to 1947—Gabor invents a way to capture light in three dimensions using interference patterns, but it remains theoretical and impractical. Then 1960 arrives: Maiman creates the laser, finally producing the coherent light Gabor needed. The moment of breakthrough: theory meets technology.

**Resolution (Scenes 10-12)**: Leith and Upatnieks create the first three-dimensional hologram in 1964. The invisible world of light has been tamed, captured, and made visible. The player realizes they're looking at the culmination of nearly 300 years of scientific discovery—a moment when light itself becomes malleable, controllable, and alive on a surface.
