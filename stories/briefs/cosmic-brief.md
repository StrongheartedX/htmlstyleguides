## Key Historical Facts

1. **Lyman Spitzer's Vision (1946)** - Astronomer Lyman Spitzer Jr. published "Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory," proposing the concept of a space telescope 44 years before its launch, planting the seed for what would become the Hubble Space Telescope.

2. **Congressional Authorization (1977)** - Congress officially authorized the construction of the Hubble Space Telescope, initiating a 13-year engineering project that would revolutionize astronomy with a 2.4-meter primary mirror designed to detect visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light.

3. **John Michell's Dark Stars (1783)** - English country parson and physicist John Michell first theorized "dark stars" invisible to telescopes by applying Newton's law of gravity and escape velocity calculations—this was the first conceptual framework for what we now call black holes, 132 years before Einstein's relativity.

4. **Einstein's General Relativity (1915)** - Albert Einstein published his groundbreaking General Relativity theory, which became the mathematical foundation for understanding black holes and their properties.

5. **Schwarzschild Radius Discovery (1916)** - Karl Schwarzschild solved Einstein's field equations and determined the critical radius of a black hole, establishing the "Schwarzschild Radius" formula still used today to calculate event horizons.

6. **Kerr Black Holes (1963)** - Roy Kerr solved the equations for rotating black holes, proving that real black holes in the universe spin, fundamentally changing theoretical understanding of these cosmic objects.

7. **Frank Drake's Drake Equation (1961)** - Astronomer Frank Drake formulated the Drake equation at the first scientific meeting on SETI, creating a probabilistic framework estimating the number of communicative civilizations in the Milky Way through seven multiplicative factors.

8. **Project Ozma (1960)** - Frank Drake conducted the first systematic search for extraterrestrial radio signals using the 85-foot (26-meter) radio dish at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, monitoring Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti.

9. **Voyager 1 Launch (September 5, 1977)** - NASA launched Voyager 1, carrying the famous Voyager Golden Record—a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk with 116 images, musical selections from different cultures, spoken greetings in 55 languages, and sounds representing Earth's diversity, curated by Carl Sagan.

10. **Voyager 2 Launch (August 20, 1977)** - Voyager 2 was launched 16 days before its twin, on an identical mission to explore the outer planets with its own Voyager Golden Record featuring the inscription "To the makers of music – all worlds, all times."

11. **Cygnus X-1 Discovery (1972)** - Astronomers Louise Webster, Paul Murdin, and independently Charles Thomas Bolton identified Cygnus X-1 through combined X-ray and optical observations, proving it was a binary system with the supergiant star HDE 226868 and determining the invisible object's mass far exceeded white dwarf or neutron star limits—the first definitive black hole candidate.

12. **Hubble Launch & Flaw (April 24, 1990)** - Space Shuttle Discovery successfully deployed the Hubble Space Telescope on STS-31 mission, but within weeks astronomers discovered its primary mirror was ground to incorrect specifications, producing fuzzy out-of-focus images instead of the crisp deep-space views promised.

13. **First Servicing Mission Repair (December 1993)** - Shuttle Endeavour carried astronauts to Hubble in a 10-day mission that installed COSTAR corrective optics and the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), restoring the telescope's vision and transforming it into the most productive scientific instrument ever built.

14. **LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection (February 11, 2016)** - The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration announced GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves from a black hole merger 1.4 billion light-years away, confirming Einstein's century-old predictions with extraordinary precision.

## Dramatic Arc

**Setup (Scenes 1-3):** Protagonist discovers an inherited transmitter in an attic, accidentally tunes it to receive signals from Voyager 1 and Hubble. The first message: "Are we alone?"

**Rising Tension (Scenes 4-7):** Increasingly urgent scientific queries arrive: "What is Cygnus X-1?" "Can we detect gravitational waves?" "Where is the alien signal?" The transmitter shows coordinates and dates from 1972 forward, revealing a timeline of cosmic discovery.

**Climax (Scenes 8-10):** Protagonist realizes the signals are from future humanity, showing discoveries not yet made in their timeline. A message arrives: "Choose: Reply and change history, or remain silent."

**Resolution (Scenes 11-12):** Protagonist's final choice determines whether they send humanity's answer to the cosmos, reflecting on Sagan's message of peace encoded 45 years earlier on the Golden Record.
