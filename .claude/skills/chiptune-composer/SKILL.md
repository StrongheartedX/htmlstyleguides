# Chiptune Composer

Compose a full-length chiptune song using **$ARGUMENTS**.

Output a complete `.json` song file in the compact event format defined by `games/audio-tracker/AI-SONG-FORMAT.md`. The song should be 3-4 minutes long with full structural development — not a short loop.

## Phase 0 — Parse Request & Plan

1. Parse the argument for style, key, BPM, and description hints.
2. Read `games/audio-tracker/AI-SONG-FORMAT.md` for the compact event format spec.
3. Read `games/audio-tracker/songs/index.json` to see existing songs and avoid duplicates.
4. Read one existing song JSON (e.g., `boss-battle.json` or `canon-in-d.json`) to calibrate output density and formatting.
5. Select the appropriate style profile from the **Style Profiles** section below.
6. Plan the song structure:
   - Key, mode, BPM, time feel
   - Song form (e.g., AABA, ABACBA, Intro-Verse-Chorus-Bridge-Chorus-Outro)
   - Number of unique patterns needed (typically 8-20 for a 3-4 min track)
   - Instrument palette (4 channels: melody, harmony/countermelody, bass, percussion)
   - Harmonic plan: chord progression per section, modulation points
   - Melodic motif(s): the 3-6 note seed that unifies the track
7. Present the plan and discuss before composing.

## Phase 1 — Compose

Build the song JSON section by section. For each section:

1. **Establish the harmonic foundation** — write bass channel events first (chord roots, walking bass, ostinato, or pedal point depending on style).
2. **Add percussion** — lay down the rhythmic backbone appropriate to the style and tempo.
3. **Write the melody** — compose the lead channel using the motif, developing it through repetition, sequence, inversion, augmentation, or diminution.
4. **Add countermelody/harmony** — fill the second pitched channel with supporting material (arpeggiated chords, counter-lines, echo effects, or pad sustains).

### Composition Rules

- **Motif-first**: Define a 3-6 note melodic cell. Every section should derive from or relate to this motif.
- **Vary repeats**: Never copy a section identically more than twice in the sequence. Add ornaments, octave shifts, or rhythmic variations.
- **Voice independence**: Melody and harmony channels should have contrary or oblique motion most of the time. Avoid parallel octaves/fifths between channels.
- **Register separation**: Keep bass in MIDI 36-55, melody in 60-84, harmony flexible but avoid crossing the melody.
- **Phrase structure**: Use 4-bar or 8-bar phrases (16 or 32 rows at rpb=4). End phrases with clear cadences.
- **Dynamic arc**: Build intensity across the song. Use sparser textures for intros and bridges, denser for climaxes.

### Pattern Transition Techniques

Smooth transitions between patterns are critical — abrupt simultaneous channel switches create a jarring "seam" effect. Use these techniques to create musical flow across pattern boundaries:

- **Cross-boundary sustains**: End patterns with notes whose `d` extends past the pattern length. The engine handles this via timed note-off scheduling — a note at row 28 with `d: 8` in a 32-row pattern will sustain 4 rows into the next pattern. Use this on melody or pad channels to glue sections together.

- **Pickup notes / anacrusis**: Place 1-2 melody notes in the last 1-2 rows of the preceding pattern to lead into the downbeat of the next section. This is the most natural transition technique — the listener's ear follows the pickup into the new phrase. Example: in a 32-row pattern, add a note at row 30 or 31 that anticipates the melody of the next pattern.

- **Transition patterns**: Write short 8-16 row bridge patterns (drum fills, bass walk-ups, scalar runs, cymbal rolls) to insert between major sections. These don't need to be unique per transition — a single 8-row fill pattern can be reused at multiple section boundaries.

- **Staggered channel changes**: Use independent per-channel sequencing instead of switching all 4 channels simultaneously. For example, `[5, 3, 3, 3]` keeps bass/drums/harmony on the old pattern while melody switches, then `[5, 5, 5, 5]` on the next row completes the transition. Not every row needs this — reserve it for the biggest section changes (intro→verse, verse→chorus, bridge→final chorus).

- **Harmonic preparation**: In the last 2-4 rows of a pattern, prepare the harmony of the next section. Use dominant→tonic resolution, leading tone movement, or bass walk-ups to the new root. A bass channel walking up chromatically in the last 4 rows (e.g., E→F→F#→G to arrive at G) creates a smooth harmonic bridge.

- **Avoid hard cuts on all channels**: Don't place `n: -1` note-offs on the final row of every channel simultaneously. Instead, let some channels ring through (via cross-boundary `d`) while others cut, creating a staggered fade rather than an abrupt wall of silence.

- **Drum fills at section boundaries**: Replace the last 4-8 rows of a percussion pattern with a fill (rapid snare hits, tom rolls, accelerating hi-hats) to signal an upcoming section change. This is the most universally effective transition — listeners instinctively recognize drum fills as section markers.

### Pattern & Sequence Math

For a 3-4 minute song:
- At 120 BPM, rpb=4, 32-row patterns: each pattern = 4 bars = 8 seconds. Need ~22-30 sequence entries.
- At 80 BPM, rpb=4, 32-row patterns: each pattern = 4 bars = 12 seconds. Need ~15-20 sequence entries.
- At 160 BPM, rpb=4, 32-row patterns: each pattern = 4 bars = 6 seconds. Need ~30-40 sequence entries.

Reuse patterns via the sequence array — compose 8-20 unique patterns, arrange them into a full song via sequencing.

## Phase 1b — Relay Mode (for epic-length compositions)

For songs longer than 4 minutes, or when the user requests multiple parallel/sequential compositions, use the **Haiku Relay Pattern** instead of composing in a single agent. This was proven with a 130-pattern, 5.2-minute power metal epic.

### How It Works

1. **Opus plans the architecture**: Define instruments, section descriptions (10-30 sections), key/mode/energy per section, and the number of patterns each agent should compose (~13 patterns ≈ 30 seconds at most tempos).

2. **Write the master plan** to `games/audio-tracker/songs/_chunks-{song-name}/instruments.json` with the instrument array and section descriptions.

3. **Launch sequential Haiku agents**, each composing one section. Each agent receives:
   - The instrument definitions (constant)
   - Its section description (from the plan)
   - **The handoff payload** from the previous agent — the sustaining notes at the end of the last pattern

4. **Extract handoff notes** between agents using `games/audio-tracker/songs/_ttfaf-chunks/extract_handoff.py`:
   ```bash
   python3 extract_handoff.py chunk-NN.json
   ```
   This outputs the last sounding note per channel (note, instrument, volume, whether it sustains past the pattern boundary).

5. **Each agent's prompt must include**:
   - "These notes are ALREADY RINGING when your section begins: Ch0: X, Ch1: Y, Ch2: Z, Ch3: W"
   - "Let them ring 2-4 rows before your new notes take over"
   - The specific handoff notes to leave sustaining at the END of their last pattern (so the next agent can continue seamlessly)
   - "This is 100% original composition" (avoids copyright refusal for cover-inspired work)

6. **Merge all chunks** at the end:
   ```bash
   python3 merge.py  # in the chunks directory
   ```
   This remaps pattern IDs and stitches sequences into one song.

### Relay Prompt Template

```
You are composing Section N of M of an ORIGINAL [genre] chiptune epic called "[Title]." 100% original composition.

## INCOMING HANDOFF — Already ringing:
- Ch0: [note] (MIDI [num]), inst [idx] — sustaining
- Ch1: [note] (MIDI [num]), inst [idx] — sustaining
- Ch2: [note] (MIDI [num]), inst [idx] — sustaining
- Ch3: [description]

Let ring 2-4 rows before new notes.

## YOUR SECTION: "[Section Name]" — Section N of M
[Description of what this section should sound like]

**Key**: [key/mode]
**Energy**: [X/10]
**Patterns**: 13 (IDs 0-12), 32 rows, [BPM] BPM, rpb=4

## INSTRUMENTS
[List with indices]

## COMPOSE
[Detailed per-pattern guidance]

### HANDOFF (Pattern 12):
- Ch0: row 28, n:[note], inst [idx], d:8
- Ch1: row 28, n:[note], inst [idx], d:8
- Ch2: row 24, n:[note], inst [idx], d:12
- Ch3: [drum fill or crash description]

## OUTPUT: Write to `games/audio-tracker/songs/_chunks-{name}/chunk-NN.json`
```

### When to Use Relay Mode
- User requests a song longer than 4 minutes
- User asks for "epic", "through-composed", or "suite" style compositions
- User wants to compose in a specific genre that benefits from many distinct sections (power metal, progressive rock, symphony)
- User explicitly asks for parallel or sequential agent composition

## Phase 2 — Output

1. Write the complete JSON to `games/audio-tracker/songs/{kebab-case-title}.json`.
2. Update `games/audio-tracker/songs/index.json` to add the new song entry.
3. Verify the JSON is valid and all pattern IDs referenced in the sequence exist.

## Available Wave Types

The synth engine supports these wave types for instruments:
- `square` — 50% duty cycle pulse (NES Pulse 50%), warm and full
- `pulse25` — 25% duty cycle pulse (NES Pulse 25%), reedy and bright
- `pulse12` — 12.5% duty cycle pulse, thin and nasal
- `triangle` — triangle wave (NES-style bass), no volume envelope, thumpy
- `sawtooth` — sawtooth wave (SNES-style lead), rich harmonics
- `sine` — pure sine, good for pads and sub-bass
- `noise` — white noise for percussion

### Instrument Parameters

```json
{
  "name": "Display Name",
  "wave": "square|pulse25|pulse12|triangle|sawtooth|sine|noise",
  "a": 0.01,          // attack time (seconds)
  "d": 0.1,           // decay time
  "s": 0.6,           // sustain level (0-1)
  "r": 0.1,           // release time
  "vol": 0.7,         // master volume (0-1)
  "detune": 0,         // cents detune (optional)
  "detuneOsc": false,  // enable 2nd detuned oscillator (optional)
  "detuneAmount": 7,   // detune amount for 2nd osc (optional)
  "filterType": "none|lowpass|highpass|bandpass",  // optional
  "filterFreq": 2000,  // filter cutoff Hz (optional)
  "filterQ": 1         // filter resonance (optional)
}
```

### Percussion Conventions

Noise instruments ignore pitch, but use these MIDI note conventions for readability:
- **48** = kick drum (lowpass filter, filterFreq ~150-200, short decay)
- **60** = snare (bandpass filter, filterFreq ~1000-1500, medium decay)
- **72** = hi-hat (highpass filter, filterFreq ~6000, very short decay)
- **64** = open hi-hat (highpass, longer decay)
- **56** = tom (can use triangle wave with short decay instead)

## Style Profiles

Read `references/style-profiles.md` for detailed harmonic, melodic, and structural conventions for each style:

- **RPG Battle** — fast, minor, chromatic, driving
- **RPG Boss** — intense, complex meter possible, chromaticism + syncopation
- **Overworld/Adventure** — Lydian/major, memorable melody, moderate-fast
- **Town/Village** — gentle, waltz or 4/4, pentatonic or jazz voicings
- **Dungeon/Cave** — sparse, dissonant, tritones, drones
- **Shop/Inn** — light, major, short loops, cozy
- **Victory Fanfare** — Mixolydian, brass-like, triumphant
- **Classical Arrangement** — adapt a known classical piece to 4 channels
- **Ambient/Atmospheric** — slow, evolving textures, pedal points
